# Succulent Supply

🌵 An eCommerce hub for all your succulent needs! 🌵Project complete! This project was built by Annalee Switek. 

(👷🏻‍♀️ Apologies, site is currently down )

While demo-ing, you can: 

1. Add succulents to your cart
2. Click a succulent to view it's description and reviews
3. Visit your cart and change the quantity of items
4. Close your browser, re-open, and see that your cart persists
5. Checkout, and visit a thank you view. Your order has been added to the db! 
6. Review a succulent and see your review posted to the succulents description page. 

Note: the "Succulent Supply" logo on the top left in the nav bar will bring you back to the catalog. 

Thanks for visiting Succulent Supply! I built this as some light practice with React, Redux, Express, Sequelize, Postgres, styling and local storage.
